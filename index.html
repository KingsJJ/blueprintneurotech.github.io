				</header>
				
				<div class="dark">
					<p> Innovators developing groundbreaking medical device technologies face several challenges along the translational path from bench to bedside. 
						The NIH Blueprint MedTech: Incubator Hubs aim to address such challenges by accelerating the development of 
						cutting-edge medical devices to diagnose and treat disorders of the nervous system or consequences of such a disease or injury. 
						This program will catalyze the translation of novel technologies from early-stage development to a prototype ready for first-in-human-testing 
						and will provide: (a) non-dilutive funds to support medical device development activities, 
						(b) ongoing, specialized support from experienced executive mentors and 
						(c) additional resources and support services including, but not limited to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Assistance from Hubs and consultants (e.g., on design, regulatory, reimbursement, intellectual property,
							commercialization, and strategic partnership issues).</li>
						<li>Resources to plan and support concept development, team building, needs assessment, and other early 
							translational activities.</li>
						<li>Other resources listed on the 
							<a href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/blueprint-medtech/blueprint-medtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blueprint MedTech Website</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Center for Innovative NeuroTech Advancement (CINTA) and NeuroTech Harbor (NTH) are the two NIH-funded Incubator Hubs that will 
						provide funding and in-kind resources to innovator teams. The objective of Hub support is to develop and de-risk
						these groundbreaking technologies to the point of first-in-human-testing. By the conclusion of CINTA or NTH funding, it is 
						anticipated that all projects will have non-governmental funding secured or be ready for entry into the companion solicitations from NIH: </p>
					<ul>

						<li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-282.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blueprint Medtech: Small Business Translator (U44)</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p> These companion solicitations support first-in-human evaluations of safety and effectiveness.</p>

						<h2>Funding Opportunity</h2>
					</div>
				</header>
				<div class="dark">
					<p>CINTA and NTH seek groundbreaking collaborative projects to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and/or treatment 
						of disorders involving the nervous system or consequences of such a disease or injury. The technologies proposed
						in applications must have a pathway to a prototype ready for first-in-human testing within 4 years. Projects should
						be viable candidates for commercial development.
					</p>
					<p><b>Awards from NTH or CINTA will rarely exceed $500,000 in direct costs per year for a period of up to 4 years. </b>
						In addition to monetary support, awardees will receive ongoing, specialized support from mentors experienced in 
						commercializing medical devices. Awardees will work with their individual mentor each week to focus on business, 
						regulatory, clinical, and technical factors that may impede commercialization.   
					</p>
					<p>The Blueprint MedTech Hubs and NIH encourage applications from women, underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, as well 
						as individuals with disabilities.

						<h2>Review Process and Eligibility</h2>
					</div>
				</header>
				<div class="dark">
					<p>Applicants must submit pre-proposals, which will undergo review by CINTA, NTH, and NIH 
						program scientific staff. Pre-proposals are submitted through a simple online application form (available soon)
						<!-- <a href="https://colab.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/119/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a simple online application form</a> -->
						equivalent to approximately 4 pages.
					</p>
					<p>A subset of applicants will be invited to submit full proposals through the same online application system. The full 
						proposal form is equivalent to approximately ten pages. A subset of the applicants who submit full proposals will
						be selected to participate in an advanced, interactive “deep dive” evaluation, which is the final stage of review 
						prior to funding decisions. 
					</p>
					<p>Another subset of the applicants who submit full proposals will be invited to participate in the companion Seedling 
						program and be awarded up to $50,000 total cost. The Seedling program is akin to a planning grant that will provide 
						training and mentoring to help applicants refine the intended target product profile and regulatory and reimbursement 
						strategies in order to strengthen subsequent applications to the program. 
					</p>
					<p>Principal Investigators (PIs) from academic institutions, industry, and non-profit organizations are invited to apply. 
						Any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the 
						Principal Investigator(s) is (are) invited to work with their organization to develop and submit a proposal.
					</p>
					<p>Applicants should consider avenues to support diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in their proposals. 
						This may be addressed by including team members or collaborators from groups that are traditionally underrepresented 
						in the translational workforce or by considering population factors such as racial and ethnic groups, gender, and 
						disabilities.  Proposals that address conditions or clinical indications where current diagnostic or treatment 
						options disproportionately fail to serve underrepresented populations are encouraged.  
					</p>
					<p>All pre-proposals, full proposals, and deep dive discussions will be conducted on a confidential basis.</p>
